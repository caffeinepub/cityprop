# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish the currently deployed Draft Version 29 to production so it becomes the active version served to end users.

**Planned changes:**
- Promote Draft Version 29 to the production environment.
- Verify post-publish that the production app loads successfully and core routes render (Landing page, role selection, dashboards).
- Do not modify source code unless a blocking production issue is discovered during verification.

**User-visible outcome:** End users see Draft Version 29 as the default production app, and the main pages/routes load successfully.
