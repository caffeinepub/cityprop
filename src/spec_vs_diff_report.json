The diff shows documentation plus source-code changes (backend/main.mo and other frontend-related summaries), but does not provide evidence of an actual promotion of Draft Version 29 to production. The presence of code changes also appears to violate the stated constraint to not modify source code during publish unless blocking issues are found (no such blocking issue is evidenced).",
